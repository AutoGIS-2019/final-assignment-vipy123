# Feedback for the final assignment

Very interesting and important topic for the final work!  If you want, you could discuss further with Joose Helle who has developed the clean path application (in Javascript) :). Also, if you haven't already taken it, I recommend that you have a look at the full stack course offered by the CS department :)

Please find detailed feedback below. Suggestions for improvement are marked as **bold**.

## Points:
- Major analysis steps: 35
- Overall documentation: 8
- Extra points: 5
- Total: 48

### Overall documentation and structure: 

- Very interesting and important topic!
- Clear and concise description of the analysis workflow, sources and results. 
- Visual preview of the result would have been a nice addition but not required. All in all very good! 
- The notebook file requires a bit more markdown formatting (looks like you have developed the code in a python script and then copied into a notebook?). 
- Consider using only English variable names and pothole naming 

### Tools (data acquisition and analysis) 

- Everything works!


### Visualization 
- What do the different colors mean? This should be evident by just looking at the map (legend is missing).

### Extra merits
- Very interesting own topic. A lot of effort was put into this work.
- being patient with re-installing things on your computer :D
